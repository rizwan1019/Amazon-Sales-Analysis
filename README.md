# Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project
## Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze Amazon sales data to uncover insights about top-selling products, seasonal trends, and customer preferences.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing and analysis.
pandas: To clean, manipulate, and analyze the sales dataset.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.
matplotlib & seaborn: For visualizing sales trends and patterns through charts and graphs.
Process:
Data Collection:

The dataset consisted of Amazon sales information, including product categories, order dates, customer ratings, and revenue.
Data Cleaning:

Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a usable format.
Converted dates to a proper format and categorized product types for better analysis.
Data Analysis:

Top-Selling Products: Identified the most popular products by sales volume and revenue.
Seasonal Trends: Analyzed sales data over different time periods (months, seasons) to understand peak sales periods.
Customer Preferences: Explored customer ratings and preferences across various product categories.
Data Visualization:

Created line charts to show monthly sales trends and highlight peak seasons.
Bar plots to compare sales performance across different product categories.
Heatmaps to show correlations between customer ratings and sales figures.
Challenges:

Handling large datasets efficiently and ensuring accurate analysis after data cleaning.
Identifying seasonal trends accurately by normalizing date-related data.
Outcome:
The analysis provided valuable insights into Amazonâ€™s sales performance:

Identified the best-selling products and categories.
Highlighted peak sales seasons, particularly around holiday periods.
Found correlations between high customer ratings and increased sales for certain product types.
Future Enhancements:
Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews to understand customer satisfaction better.
Predict future sales using machine learning models.
